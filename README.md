# Pen-Levitator
This is a 3d model of a stand for a pen and a pen casing. For this project, you will need 4 neodymium magnets, 1 mm by 6 mm, and any standard ink chamber of a pen.
To assemble the pen, first place the ink chamber inside the long main tube. Next, glue the small circular part with an indentation on the top of the pen. Place 2 magnets inside the indentation, then glue on the final shallow circle.
To assemble the stand, place 2 magnets on the top of your completed pen. Drop some glue into the indentation at the top of the stand, then place the magnets (which are on top of the pen) into the indentation, so that the magnets are all facing the same direction. If the second magnet comes undone, simply glue it to the first magnet in the indentation.
